## What Are Transformers?
- Transformers were first developed to solve the problem of sequence transduction, or neural machine translation, which means they are meant to solve any task that transforms an input sequence to an output sequence. This is why they are called “Transformers”.
But let’s start from the beginning.
### What Are Transformer Models?
- A transformer model is a neural network that learns the context of sequential data and generates new data out of it.
To put it simply:
```
A transformer is a type of artificial intelligence model that learns to understand and generate human-like text by analyzing patterns in large amounts of text data.
```
- Transformers are a current state-of-the-art NLP model and are considered the evolution of the encoder-decoder architecture. However, while the encoder-decoder architecture relies mainly on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to extract sequential information, Transformers completely lack this recurrency.
- So, how do they do it?
- They are specifically designed to comprehend context and meaning by analyzing the relationship between different elements, and they rely almost entirely on a mathematical technique called attention to do so.
