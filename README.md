# ML Notes

A collection of concise, topic-wise notes on Machine Learning.  
Each topic is documented in a single file that brings together:  

- Mathematical foundations: equations, derivations, and step-by-step explanations.  
- Practical perspectives: implementation insights and applied use-cases.  
- Architectural overviews: structured breakdowns of models and algorithms.  
- Diagrams: visuals that clarify key ideas.  

The goal is to make this a reliable knowledge base that is rigorous yet practical, minimal yet insightful.

## Planned Repository Structure 
```
ML-Personal-Notes/
│── topic-1.md / topic-1.pdf # Notes for a specific ML topic
│── topic-2.md / topic-2.pdf # Notes for another topic
│── ...
│── README.md # You are here
│── template-topic.md # Template for creating new notes
```

Each file is self-contained: math, practice, architecture, and diagrams are all included in one place.

## Purpose  

- Keep notes short, structured, and easy to reference.  
- Make mathematical concepts intuitive and approachable.  
- Always connect theory to practical usage.  
- Serve as a quick reference for interviews, projects, or revisions.

## Contributing  

Contributions are welcome to expand and refine this collection of notes.  

### What to Contribute  
- New topic notes (Markdown or PDF).  
- Additional derivations or alternative proofs for clarity.  
- Practical insights that link mathematics to implementation.  
- Diagrams or visual aids that simplify understanding.  

### Contribution Standards  
1. One file per topic — include math, practical insights, architecture, and diagrams together.  
2. Use Markdown for editable notes; PDFs are optional for polished versions.  
3. Write mathematics clearly (LaTeX formatting preferred in Markdown).  
4. Keep explanations concise and structured; prefer bullets over long paragraphs.  
5. Ensure diagrams are clean, labeled, and embedded in the file.  
6. Maintain a consistent flow within each topic:  
   - Introduction  
   - Mathematical derivations  
   - Practical perspective  
   - Architecture overview  
   - Diagrams  

### How to Contribute  
1. Fork this repository.  
2. Add or update a topic file (`topic-name.md` or `topic-name.pdf`).  
3. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes and the topic covered.
