## Contributing  

Contributions are welcome to expand and refine this collection of notes.  

### What to Contribute  
- New topic notes (Markdown or PDF).  
- Additional derivations or alternative proofs for clarity.  
- Practical insights that link mathematics to implementation.  
- Diagrams or visual aids that simplify understanding.  

### Contribution Standards  
1. One file per topic â€” include math, practical insights, architecture, and diagrams together.  
2. Use Markdown for editable notes; PDFs are optional for polished versions.  
3. Write mathematics clearly (LaTeX formatting preferred in Markdown).  
4. Keep explanations concise and structured; prefer bullets over long paragraphs.  
5. Ensure diagrams are clean, labeled, and embedded in the file.  
6. Maintain a consistent flow within each topic:  
   - Introduction  
   - Mathematical derivations  
   - Practical perspective  
   - Architecture overview  
   - Diagrams
